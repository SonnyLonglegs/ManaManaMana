# ManaManaMana
There's too many types of Mana, and in JEI or NEI, searching for one leaves you confused when it's the other mod's type. You shouldn't need to check the mod name to find out what magic power you're using.


Versions will be supported whenever I get around to it, which usually means whenever I'm playing that version.
## Current Versions:
  1.20.1

## Current Name Changes by Mod
  Botania: Vitality, Vita ___, Vitasteel, instead of Mana, Mana items, and Manasteel

## Future Planned Name Changes
  Ars Nouveau: Source instead of Mana, and Source Capacity instead of Max Mana for an extra tiny bit of flair.
  Mahou Tsukai: Small change, the staff and scroll of Explosive Mana Condensation will be getting a new name.

## Mod I've chosen to keep "Mana"
  Iron's Spells and Spellbooks. Mostly because I feel like it.
